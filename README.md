# pocket-patches

## A short intro

I know almost nothing about what I'm doing -- I am a programmer, however, I am
definitely not familiar with programming for the Gameboy. As such, I decided to
take a swing at patching ROMs I'm interested in to play on the Analogue Pocket.
Any and all help and suggestions are welcome, since I am learning the ropes as I
go.

## Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru (English patch)

This converts `Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru (English v1.0)` to the `.pocket`
format.

The following is broken, I will continue to work on it but will gladly welcome
any suggestions from people more experienced in the scene than I am, because I
have no idea what I'm doing.

- Top and bottom of main menu are cut off.
- Character info bar shows incorrect tiles when a sprite crosses it.
- Pause menu screen transition is janky.
